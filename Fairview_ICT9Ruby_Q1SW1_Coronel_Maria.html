		Composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and sang by Christine and the Phantom, the song 'Phantom of the Opera' is one of the most famous and iconic songs from the musical with the same name, The Phantom of the Opera. This song plays as Christine gets lured away from the main building of the Palais Garnier and into the secret passage with the Phantom which is the mirror that she was staring into. Its lyrics expands on the teacher-student relationship between Christine and the Phantom.

		'Phantom of the Opera' is in my top 3 because I was captivated by the elegant vocals with the grand instrumentals. The organ opening the song, the electric guitar riffs, and the seamless incorporation of beats, the high notes at the end—such perfection. I know for sure that anyone would hold on to their seats listening to this song live to prevent being blown away.

		There are many versions of this song, but my favorite is the 2011 Royal Albert Hall rendition, sang live by Sierra Boggess as Christine and Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom for the musical's 25th anniversary. Sierra's voice perfectly projects the innocence and curiosity of Christine, and her E6 sounds so clean with the vibrato. Ramin's voice as the Phantom compliments Sierra's very well, the power and authority is just so satisfying to the ear—it feels as if you ate a good meal after craving it for weeks. The two's voices blends so nicely, and their chemistry adds to our listening experience tremendously.

		Sang by Laufey and Beabadoobee, 'A Night to Remember' is a song that tells about familiarity with a stranger, a feeting experience, and a romantic evening under blankets. It was released in 2023, being the first collaboration between the two artists who were gaining popularity.

		Unlike 'Phantom of the Opera', the vibe of 'A Night to Remember' is more lighthearted and carefree, and that's what I like about it. The piano makes it feel nostalgic, yet the light drums makes us feel like we've moved on from that. The string instruments add to the dreamy and fleeting atmosphere of the song—you can never go wrong with jazz and bossanova. Beabadobee and Laufey's vocals blends seamlessly, but you can still hear the distinction between the two's voices.

		Though I don't exactly relate to the song, it still feels very me. I'm someone who moves on sort of quickly, even if that experience was unforgettable, and personally, this song embodies that. This song usually slaps the hardest the night after I've completed an achievement, since that feeling of accomplishment was strong and real at that moment, but now gone and just a memory.

		'Got style', sang by Solene and produced by Minthaze and Saimsoul, is the second song from Solene's album 'Chase the Stars' released in 2024. It's a cyber jazz song about being that girl that catches everyone's eyes as she walks by the streets in Japan.

		The futuristic vibe of 'got style' is what I love most about it. The static in the background, the stellar instrumentals, and the distant vocals just gives the year 3000. When I listen to this song, it's as if the environment is dead and our last threads of happiness is music.

		This song helped me get through heaps of assignments and study sessions, and it brings out my condfidence, especially when walking. In times my brain is fogging, I simply play this song along with the album and in a few minutes I can work with productivity again. It encapsulates my idea of the future, dark skies and neon lights, with a glimmer of optimism that humanity will survuve.
